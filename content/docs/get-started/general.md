There are two things needed for using Fluvio. The first is the Fluvio CLI.
Second is the database on which Fluvio stores it's cluster.

Currently there are two options for managing it:
- Using the InfinyOn Cloud
- Installing Kubernetes locally on your computer



## Install Fluvio CLI

The Fluvio CLI (_command-line interface_) is an all-in-one tool for setting up, interacting, and managing with Fluvio clusters.

Install the Fluvio CLI by running the following command:

%copy first-line%
```bash
curl -fsS https://packages.fluvio.io/v1/install.sh | bash
```

## Setting up Fluvio:

At this point, there are multiple ways to install

{{< h-list tabTotal="5" tabID="2" tabName1="Cloud / Raspberry Pi" tabName2="Linux" tabName3="MacOS (Intel)" tabName4="MacOS (M1)" tabName5="‚ö† Windows ‚ö†">}}

{{<h-item tabNum="1">}}

### Cloud and Raspberry Pi:

Using the InfinyOn Cloud is the easiest way to use Fluvio.

Head on over to the [InfinyOn Cloud signup page](https://infinyon.cloud) to create an account.

     alt="A screenshot of the InfinyOn new account form, with Name, Organization, Email, and Password fields"
     style="justify: center; max-width: 300px" />

After filling out the form, you'll be greeted with a success message telling you to verify your email. You'll need to complete this step in order to continue.

<img src="../images/cloud-verification.jpg"
     alt="A screenshot of the verification email received after completing the signup form, including a verification link"
     style="justify: center; max-width: 500px" />

You should get a confirmation that your account is ready to use

<img src="../images/cloud-confirmation.jpg"
     alt="A screenshot of the prompt received after clicking the verification link, saying the account is ready to use"
     style="justify: center; max-width: 300px" />


At this point, we can log in via the Fluvio CLI and start sending and receiving messages to your Fluvio cluster. To log in with the CLI, you'll need to run the `fluvio cloud login` command, then type in your email and password when prompted.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio cloud login
InfinyOn Cloud email: batman@justiceleague.com
Password:
```

You'll be able to tell that everything worked if your current profile is set to `cloud`. You can check with this command:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio profile current
cloud
```

If you installed fluvio locally it will be listed alongside `cloud`:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio profile list
    PROFILE       CLUSTER       ADDRESS                          TLS 
    local         local         localhost:9003                   Disabled 
 *  cloud         cloud         router.infinyon.cloud:9003       Verified
```

-> Use `fluvio profile switch` command to switch between clusters.

### Linux

#### Installing a Kubenetes Cluster

For installing the cluster on your local machine, here are some suggested Kubernetes installation options:
  * [K3d](https://k3d.io)
  * [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io)
  * [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

Most of these should be available in your package manager. If it turns out they are not, it is a simple download! 
Not quite as simple as using the cloud, though.

### Mac OS Intel

_[This is rather sparse for information,]_

#### Installing a Kubenetes Cluster

We recommend [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) as the Kubernetes cluster of choice. 
Please follow the instructions in the link for Mac OS.

-> Thanks to homebrew on MacOS, you can avoid downloading random files off of websites, and can instead download random files in your command line!

### Mac OS M1

_[A bit less sparse compared to Intel]_

#### Installing a Kubenetes Cluster

We recommend using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) as the Kubernetes cluster for the M1 Macs. 
Please follow the instructions for installing.

### Windows

~> At the current moment Windows is not supported.

_[Should we test out running k8s and fluvio in wsl?
I guess best suggestion would be to install fluvio CLI and use the cloud]_

## Checking Installs

Some of Kubernetes installation will install `kubectl` and `helm`, and `Docker` is a requirement for several Kubernetes systems.  You can check their install status by:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"24", GitVersion:"v1.24.2", GitCommit:"f66044f4361b9f1f96f0053dd46cb7dce5e990a8", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2022-06-15T14:22:29Z", GoVersion:"go1.18.3", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Kustomize Version: v4.5.4
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"24", GitVersion:"v1.24.1", GitCommit:"3ddd0f45aa91e2f30c70734b175631bec5b5825a", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2022-05-24T12:18:48Z", GoVersion:"go1.18.2", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```

-> Note, the output of this command is soon due to change, do not worry if there is a warning attached to it.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.8.2", 
GitCommit:"d506314abfb5d21419df8c7e7e68012379db2354", 
GitTreeState:"clean", 
GoVersion:"go1.17.11"}
```

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.17-ce, build a89b84221c85
```

If any of these were not installed, you can installed them the following way:


### Install Kubectl

`kubectl` is the Kubernetes command-line tool. It is used to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.

Follow the instructions at the [kubectl installation page] and you will soon have `kubectl` installed.

[kubectl installation page]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl

### Install Helm

`helm` is the package manager for Kubernetes. 

Follow the instructions at the [helm installation page] and you will soon have `helm` installed.

[helm installation page]: https://v3.helm.sh/docs/intro/install/ 

### Install Docker

`Docker` is container system used by several kubernetes systems. It helps ensure that everything is in its own little package and not talking to eachother.

Follow the instructions at the [Docker installation guide], it should tell you how to download and install `Docker` for your chosen OS.

[Docker installation guide]: (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## start Fluvio cluster

you can start a Fluvio cluster with the command `fluvio cluster start`.

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio cluster start

## Hello, Fluvio!

Congratulations, you've successfully installed Fluvio on your local machine! 

Let's use the Fluvio CLI to play with some basic functionality.

The first thing we need to do is create a [topic].

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio topic create greetings
topic "greetings" created
```

Now that we have a topic, we can [produce] some messages!

Use the following command to send a message to the `greetings` topic:

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ echo "Hello, Fluvio" | fluvio produce greetings
```

Finally, we can [consume] messages back from the topic

%copy first-line%
```bash
$ fluvio consume greetings -B -d
Consuming records from the beginning of topic 'greetings'
Hello, Fluvio
```

Way to go! You're well on your way to writing real-time distributed apps with Fluvio!

Next, check out our [Tutorials page] to see real-world examples of Fluvio in action.

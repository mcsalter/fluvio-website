# Changelogs directory

This is the directory for any and all changelogs that one would like to add to the website.

Everything in the `compiled` directory is automatically generated. It should not necessary to modify any file manually.

## manually adding a changelog:

Add the file to the `base` directory (creating it if needbe), and run `python /scripts/changelog.py` to generate the changelogs.
